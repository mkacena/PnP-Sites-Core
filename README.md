# PnP Sites Core Library - ARCHIVED

> **Important:**
> PnP Sites Core has been retired and archived. [PnP Framework](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework) offers the same features as a .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 5 package and we'll only maintain that version going forward. Please switch to PnP Framework if you're still using PnP Sites Core in your projects.

The [PnP Sites Core library](https://github.com/PnP/PnP-Sites-Core) is a very popular library that extends SharePoint using mainly CSOM. This library contains the PnP Provisioning engine, tons of extension methods, a modern page API, etc...but this library has also organically grown into a complex and hard to maintain code base. One of the reasons why the [PnP Core SDK](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore) development started is to provide a new clean basis for the PnP Sites Core library with a strong focus on quality (test coverage above 80%, automation). As this transition will take quite some time and effort we plan to gradually move things over from PnP Sites Core to the PnP Core SDK. The first step in this transition is releasing a .Net Standard 2.0 version of PnP Sites Core, called [PnP Framework](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework). Going forward [PnP Framework](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework) features will move to the PnP Core SDK in a phased approach. [PnP Framework](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework) version 1.0.0 (GA ðŸŽ‰) is available and beta 2 of the [PnP Core SDK](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore) is available as well.

## I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR

Given PnP Sites Core has been archived issues and PR's need to be created in the [PnP Framework](https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework) repository.
